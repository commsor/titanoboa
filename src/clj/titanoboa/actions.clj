  "Starts pool of action processors processing actions from action-requests-ch. returns async channel for stopping the processors.
  Action request is a map with fn to be invoked, its parameters and response channel. Sample action may look as follows:
  {:action-fn instantiate-job :data ['simple job' nil nil new-jobs-rmqch running-jobs job-folder] :response-ch response-ch}.
  Parameter response-ch in the map should contain core.async channel that will be used for response broadcast
  and should be used only once to avoid race conditions. The action-fn itself should never return nil."
